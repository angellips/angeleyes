**Overview:**

- The study consisted of generating two images from random seeds on the initial prompt “trees; film still”, followed by a selection of additional cinematic terms, again on random seeds.

- The additional terms were mainly sourced from [Filmsite Film Glossary](https://www.filmsite.org/filmterms.html) with few modifications. Prompt generations were then excerpted manually and added to the gallery below.

- 325 prompt generations were excerpted, ~716 prompts were used in total, and the complete prompt file can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/angellips/angeleyes/tree/main/AL-AI001notCC).
